# docker-debian10-base

Debian 10 base image

## Purpose

- This image is created as a base image for the rest of the images I build using Debian.
- The first version of this image, was based on Debian 10.0.
- The version number of my images corresponds (as of 11.0) with the version of Debian.
- It's always the slim Debian image that is used.
- The image sets the timezone.
